-- Movie Discovery App --
This is a responsive movie discovery web application built with React and powered by The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

It allows users to:
 -  Search for movies in real-time (debounced input)

 -  View trending movies of the week

 -  Tracks search popularity using Appwrite backend

 -  Fully responsive UI, deployable via Netlify

NOTE : TMDB may be blocked in certain regions or networks. If the API fails to load movies, check CORS/network restrictions or use a proxy during testing.
